The file /portfolio-website/portfolio-website/public/media/placeholder-image1.jpg is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate binary image data directly, you will need to create a placeholder image using an image editing tool or download one from a placeholder image service. 

You can create a simple placeholder image with the following steps:

1. Use an online placeholder image generator (like placeholder.com) to create an image.
2. Save the generated image as `placeholder-image1.jpg`.
3. Place it in the `/portfolio-website/public/media/` directory.
